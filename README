Private project where I get a bit more effective at test-driven development


Description of what I want this program to do:
I have a shelf of films I own.
I lend them out to friends from time to time.
I organise my films alphabetically, ignoring the word "The", but not the word "a"
I need to know which of my friends have my films.
I'm bad at alphabetising films so I need my program to do it for me for reference.


Classes I'll need:
Shelf
Friends
DVDs

Relationships:
Shelf holds/sorts DVDs
Friends borrow DVDs
